- 👋 Hi, I’m @Dalia-21
- 👀 I’m interested in all things programming, computer science and maths!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C, micropython and the concepts of HDL through Nand2Tetris.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much any small scale projects that I can wrap my head around for now.
- 📫 How to reach me: I'll fill this in once I have an email address I'm happy to share.
